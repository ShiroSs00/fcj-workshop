> Here, you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think it would be nice to have more social gatherings or team bonding activities to strengthen relationships.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, provides necessary documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The tasks I was assigned align well with the knowledge I learned at university, while also introducing me to new areas I had never encountered before. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports one another regardless of their position. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company provides an internship allowance and offers flexible working hours when needed. In addition, having the opportunity to join internal training sessions is a big plus.

### Additional Questions

- **What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**  
  The most satisfying aspect was seeing the direct impact of my work on real AWS projects. I particularly enjoyed collaborating with the team on cloud infrastructure solutions and receiving constructive feedback that helped me grow professionally. The opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies while contributing meaningful results was incredibly rewarding.

- **What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**  
  While the overall experience was excellent, I would suggest:

  - Establishing a more structured onboarding program for new interns
  - Creating a dedicated internal wiki or knowledge base for quick reference
  - Scheduling regular feedback sessions (bi-weekly or monthly) to track progress

- **If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not?**  
  Absolutely, I would strongly recommend this internship program to friends. The company provides genuine learning opportunities, supportive mentors, and a collaborative team environment. Unlike some internships where interns are relegated to menial tasks, here you work on meaningful projects and feel valued as a team member. The combination of professional development and positive workplace culture makes this an exceptional internship experience.
